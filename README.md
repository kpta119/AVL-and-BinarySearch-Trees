##Project structure:
The project is divided into several files:
● dijkstra.py file - contains implementations of the algorithm and its auxiliary functions
● main.py file - the main file processing the graph from the file
● test_dijkstra.py file - file with tests for the algorithm and its auxiliary functions
Installation and startup procedure
1)git clone https://github.com/kpta119/DijkstraAlgorithm.git
and to run the program:
● python3 main.py [optional argument - name of the graph file to
processing]
The running program writes to the console the information found in the graph using the Dijkstra algorithm,
optimal path between zeros. When we do not provide a calling argument
By default, the file opened by the program is graph.txt.

## Project structure: 
The project is divided into several files:
- **`AVLtree.py`** - contains implementations of the AVL tree and all operations on it
- **`bst.py`** - contains implementations of the Binary Search Tree and all operations on it
- **`main.py file`** - the main file processing graphs that comparing operations on trees
- **`test_avl.py`** - file with tests for AVL tree
- **`test_bst.py`** - file with tests for Binary Search Tree
### Installation and startup procedure
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kpta119/AVL-and-BinarySearch-Trees.git
```
2. Run the program:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The running program generates three time graphs from the number of numbers respectively for
creating BST and AVL trees, finding a given element in BST and AVL trees
and a plot of deletion of a given element against time for the BST tree. So created
charts are saved to files in png format.
